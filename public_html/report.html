			<p>This webpage has the journal entries of Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan. The journal entries are on one page, while the report of the data is on another. The data was gathered from the Seattle Government website as well as the National Centers for Environmental Information webstie. During the report we look to answer the following question: Does weather affect crimerate in the Seattle area, if so, how? and if not, what months of the year seem to be the most active months for crime in Seattle? There are roughly five hundred thousand unique data points in the crime dataset and about four thousand points in the weather dataset. The crime dataset consists of crimes recorded over the years 2008-2014. The weather dataset is the weather everyday to the present, starting in January of 2008.</p>
