		<h1> Data Report</h1>

		<h3>Some Definitions for Interpreting the Report:</h3>
		<h4>Beat:</h4>
		<p>According to Seattle's government web page, the description of the Beats are as follows. Seattle is divided into five geographic areas. Within those areas are the 5 precincts or police stations: North, East, South, West and Southwest. Precinct boundaries were determined through consideration of neighborhood boundaries, geographic and other natural boundaries.Each precinct contains smaller geographic areas called Sectors. There are 17 sectors total in the city.Each of these Sectors are divided into between 3 smaller sections called Beats (i.e. Ocean sector has three beats O1, O2, O3) These are the areas that individual patrol officers are assigned responsibility for.</p>

			<h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class='header'>Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan</p>
			<br>
			<p>This webpage has the journal entries of Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan. The journal entries are on one page, while the report of the data is on another. The data was gathered from the Seattle Government website as well as the National Centers for Environmental Information webstie. During the report we look to answer the following question: Does weather affect crimerate in the Seattle area, if so, how? and if not, what months of the year seem to be the most active months for crime in Seattle? There are roughly five hundred thousand unique data points in the crime dataset and about four thousand points in the weather dataset. The crime dataset consists of crimes recorded over the years 2008-2014. The weather dataset is the weather everyday to the present, starting in January of 2008. We chose to use the weather data from 2014 because it was the first complete year that the weather was recorded.</p>

			<h3>First Graph</h3>

			<div id="side_by_side">
				<div class="picture">
					<figure><img src="images/countByBeat.png"></figure>
				</div>

				<div class="map">
					<figure><img src="images/precinctmap.png"></figure>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The graph above shows the count of reports that every Beat responded. Beat is the police department for a certain region. This particular bar chart is showing the amount of times each beat responded to events in the year 2014. It gives a representation of where the safe and unsafe areas are in Seattle. Looking at the barchart, there are a couple places that look empty. However, after further investigation, the two Beats both have 1 response. This may be becuase of an input error when inputting the data into the dataset. This may be the case for the Beat labled W, however the Beat labled DET at the moment has not been determined. While looking at the bar chart, there are some clear indications of where there seems to be more crime compared to others. Looking at the region totals (As in all the Beats with M) the W region looks to have on average less crime than all other regions. When looking at a map, the W region is in the Southwest Precinct. Beat E2 had the largest amount in 2014 but the region M on average has the higher crime reported.</p>

			<h3>Second Graph</h3>

			<figure><img src="images/crimeAndWeather2014.png"></figure>
			<p>This chart takes the crime count for the day and the weather for the day during the year 2014. There aer two Y-axis' and the X-axis is the day throughout the year starting with January 1st as day 1. The orange line is the temperature and the blue line is the count of crime for that day. Looking at the graph, it seems that in 2014 during the hottest part of the year the amount of crime goes down. Other notable moments in 2014 when the crime was low is during the winter months and times when the temperature had a warm spike or cold spike. On the contrary, moments when the crime was high is during the spring and fall when the weather is not too warm or too cold. Crime seems to be at its peak when crime is around 55 degrees fahrenheit.</p>

			<h3>Third Graph</h3>

			<figure><img src="images/under_30.png"></figure>
			<p>Seeing that previous graph we continued on by looking specifically at crimes by subcategory for temperatures below 30 and temperatures above 60. This bar chart looks at the criteria of crimes below 30 degrees fahrenheit. We looked at the subcategory of the crime report to see what was the most common crime during the colder days in the Seattle area. Car Prowl was by far the most common type of crime during the colder days of the year. Some of the crimes that occur outside are fewer than times of the year when it is warmer out. For instance, Robbery-Street is a bit smaller than when it is warmer out. To an extent, it can be said that weather has an affect on the crime that occurs in the Seattle area. </p>

		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Fourth Graph</h3>

			<figure><img src="images/over_60.png"></figure>
			<p>And continuing on from the previous graph, this one is for the temperature of 60 degrees fahrenheit and over. So contrary to the previous graph, this one we are expecting there to more crimes that occur outdoors. Looking back at the 30 degrees and under bar chart, the Robbery-Street is an example subcategory that increases when it is warmer out. In addition, the subcategory Theft-Bicycle increases significantly as expected because more bikes will be out during the warmer days of the year. It can be seen that the majority of crime increases in the 60 degrees and over chart because there are more days with this kind of weather but it can also reflect the more common type of crime when the weather becomes colder. With less days to commit crimes for being below 30 degrees, the bar charts can show during those few days, what is the most common type of crime. Also, looking at the subcategories against eachother, Car Prowl year round regardless of the weather is much larger than any other category of crime. That said, it is always a good idea to lock your car and keep vaulables hidden or kept out of the car.</p>

			<h3>Fifth Graph</h3>

			<figure><img src="images/heatmap.png"></figure>
			<p>This heat map can be tough to understand but there is some information here that can be of use. For starters, the X-axis is each day of the year and the interval is every 30 days or roughly a month. The y-axis is the occurred time that the crime was reported. </p>

			<p>These two pictures show in what hour the most crime happend</p>
