		<h1> Data Report</h1>

		<h3>Some Definitions for Interpreting the Report:</h3>
		<h4>Beat:</h4>
		<p>According to Seattle's government web page, the description of the Beats are as follows. Seattle is divided into five geographic areas. Within those areas are the 5 precincts or police stations: North, East, South, West and Southwest. Precinct boundaries were determined through consideration of neighborhood boundaries, geographic and other natural boundaries.Each precinct contains smaller geographic areas called Sectors. There are 17 sectors total in the city.Each of these Sectors are divided into between 3 smaller sections called Beats (i.e. Ocean sector has three beats O1, O2, O3) These are the areas that individual patrol officers are assigned responsibility for.</p>

			<h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

			<p>The graph above shows the count of reports that every Beat responded. Beat is the police department for a certain region. This particular bar chart is showing the amount of times each beat responded to events in the year 2014. It gives a representation of where the safe and unsafe areas are in Seattle. Looking at the barchart, there are a couple places that look empty. However, after further investigation, the two Beats both have 1 response. This may be becuase of an input error when inputting the data into the dataset. This may be the case for the Beat labled W, however the Beat labled DET at the moment has not been determined. While looking at the bar chart, there are some clear indications of where there seems to be more crime compared to others. Looking at the region totals (As in all the Beats with M) the W region looks to have on average less crime than all other regions. When looking at a map, the W region is in the Southwest Precinct. Beat E2 had the largest amount in 2014 but the region M on average has the higher crime reported.</p>

			<p>This webpage has the journal entries of Mitchell Petellin and Andrew Millan. The journal entries are on one page, while the report of the data is on another. The data was gathered from the Seattle Government website as well as the National Centers for Environmental Information webstie. During the report we look to answer the following question: Does weather affect crimerate in the Seattle area, if so, how? and if not, what months of the year seem to be the most active months for crime in Seattle? There are roughly five hundred thousand unique data points in the crime dataset and about four thousand points in the weather dataset. The crime dataset consists of crimes recorded over the years 2008-2014. The weather dataset is the weather everyday to the present, starting in January of 2008.</p>
