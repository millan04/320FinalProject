			<p>TAndrew and I thought of how we wanted our website to look. So we planned out that we will have a multi-view website with maybe 3 or 4 pages. We also thought our Seattle Crime data set was sufficent, but we felt that it lacked a few things and was a little to generic. So we went to the websites origin and we found that within Seattle.gov we were able to find a much better data set that we will now use.</p>
